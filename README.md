The ImageJ FX Project aims to offer a new user interface for the popular scientific software ImageJ2. ImageJFX is based on the ImageJ2 API and on JavaFX : a new UI library proposed in Java.

## New fetures

* Action history
* Mini workflows
* Batch Processing (only on elements from the personal database

## Missing important features
*	ImageJ1 Plugin support and installation
*	3D support
