# ImageJFX Project

The ImageJ FX Project aims to offer a new user interface for the popular scientific software ImageJ2. ImageJFX is based on the ImageJ2 API and on JavaFX : a new UI library proposed in Java.

## New fetures
* clearer interface
* personal database (still experimental)
* Action history
* Mini workflows
* Batch Processing (only on elements from the personal database

## Missing important features
*	ImageJ1 Plugin support and installation
*	3D support



## Download

To get a hand on the last binaries, I invite you to register on the [official website](http://www.imagejfx.net).

## Getting started

Just run **start-ijfx.jar** and it should download the last version of ImageJ FX and run automatically

## Developing Plugins for ImageJFX

Developing plugins for ImageJFX is the same as developing plugins for ImageJ2. However, a little tutorial for developing plugins using ImageJFX will be soon proposed.

## Developer

If you would like to help develop ImageJ FX or get to know more about the software architecture, please refer to the [developer manual](./DEVELOPER).

## Contributor

If you would like to create plugins for ImageJ using ImageJFX, I wrote a little tutorial covering from the installation of your environment to plugin design.


## License
ImageJ FX is a user interface running on top of ImageJ and written in Java using the JavaFX technology.
