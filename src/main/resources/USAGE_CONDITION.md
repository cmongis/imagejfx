*Would you let use collect anonymous informations about how you use the softwares ?*

## What we *DON'T* collect

 - any information that could allow someone to recognize your computer (location, any hardware ID or MAC ADDRESS, etc.)
 - any workflow you could create or use
 - any path or name of file you open

## What we collect

 - Number of CPU and RAM you have (to have an idea of the configuration people use)
 - Some button you click
 - The extension of the file you open (no name)
 - The value you set for some UI Elements
 - The plugins you use
 - The time some operations take

## What we will *NOT* do with the informations

 - sell those informations (we are just scientists working for a public organism)

## What we will do with the informations
 - check the common configuration
 - check performances statistics of some parts of the software to make them faster
 - check UI elements that are mostly used and other that are not

All we want is make a better software.
