# ImageJ FX Funding campaign

ImageJ FX is a new interface for ImageJ which aims to make image analysis easier for scientists by using state-of-art User Interface technlogies and the latest User Experience trends.

Even if the project is still young, ImageJFX has the potential to become one of the best Image Analysis Software for life sciences. Thanks to it extremely modular environment, ImageJFX can be extended to cover a wide range of scientific requirements and help tons of scientists to analyse their images without going through a stip and hard learning curve. Arriving at the end of my PhD, I would like to maintain the software and raise a team dedicated to ImageJFX. To reach this goal, We are launching a crowd funding campaign to create an independant entity that will extend and maintain the project.

## What is already here
This campaign aim to maintain an existing software, which means ImageJFX already offers numerous features that are beneficial for the user :

 - Fast and smart user interface
 - Multidimensional image visualization and manipulation
 - Scientific image exploring
 - Batch processing
 - Batch segmentation
 - Segmented object exploring
 - State-of-art user interface
 - In-software help for user guidance and fast learning
 - Multiplatform : Windows, MacOSX and Linux
 - Ultra-efficient update system : updates and fix can be deployed in no-time
 - Fast : Java is faster than Matlab, Python or Matlab

 
## Not a software, a complete environment
The ultimate goal of the ImageJFX project is to blend functionnality and information access. ImageJFX should not simply be an app where the user can execute actions, but should be a complete environment where the scientist grows through using the software. This is done by increasing the amount of information accessible inside the software and make making this access intuitive. ImageJFX plans to achieve it by integrating the following features :
 
 - live chat where scientists can directly ask question and find help
 - forum search also integrating in a software
 - image analysis to theoretical courses : a click of a button and the user has access to a basic course on the specificity scientific images

## Fund and direct the future of the project
In order to satisfy the community, the rewards proposed by the  crowding campaign can be predefined plugin that they want to be implemented. In other words, by funding ImageJFX, you also serve your own interest.

You can also order specific process, visualization or complete user interfaces fitting the requirements of your project or company.

Here are the list of funding possibilities

#### Predefined funding possibilities 

 - **3€** - encouragment
 - **20€** - encouragment level 2
 - **100€** - encouragment level 3
 - **500€** - Fitting enhancement : fit the line(s) you trace as ROI with mathematical formula (makes batch fitting possible accross multiple images)
 - **500€** - 2D Fitting : fit a set of pixel using a mathematical formula

## How is the money going to be used ?
The money will be use to pay developers for at least 1 year. The more we raise, the more developers will be put on the project and the faster the software will be able to evolve.

## What makes ImageJFX an attractive project ?

ImageJ FX has been designed from the beginning to allow flexibility and extension without comprimising the user experience. Most of the time, softwares that grows in functionnalities tend to become more confusing for the users. ImageJFX employ an unique context based design which allow it to grow without hurting the user experience.
The use of the last design trend makes it also easier to abord for new users.

## What's the difference between ImageJFX and ImageJ ?

ImageJFX is an alternative user interface of ImageJ**2**. It that the core of ImageJFX runs ImageJ2. ImageJ2 plugins are compatible with ImageJFX.  The Fiji and ImageJ1 plugins can be ported for ImageJ2, but the effort required to port depends on the complexity of the plugin. 

## Is ImageJFX gonna be a paid software ? 
No, ImageJFX is free and will stay free. Customized plugins can be delivered to private companies on demand without public release but the team has no intention to make the user pay for the software.

## Do you have other plans than ImageJFX ?
